# Secure_Transact

 The project leveraged the Credit Card Fraud Detection dataset sourced from Kaggle to develop an advanced anomaly detection system. Employing Machine Learning algorithms, such as Isolation Forest and Local Outlier Factor (LOF), the primary objective was to identify and flag anomalies within real-world credit card transaction data. This initiative prioritized automating the detection of potential fraud, errors, or any rare occurrences within the transaction data, contributing to enhanced security and the prevention of financial misconduct. By harnessing the power of these ML algorithms, the project sought to proactively safeguard financial transactions and minimize the potential risks associated with credit card fraud and irregularities, thereby offering a significant advancement in financial security.

**Secure_Transact** harnesses the power of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and employs a sophisticated blend of deep learning techniques to detect and mitigate a spectrum of cybersecurity threats. Our approach involves the integration of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), and Long Short-Term Memory networks (LSTMs) to address the challenges posed by weak passwords, XXS injections, malicious URLs, and phishing URLs.

For weak password detection, we utilize CNNs to analyze and classify character sequences, thereby identifying passwords that are susceptible to brute-force attacks or are commonly used across various platforms. RNNs and LSTMs come into play when dealing with XXS injection detection, enabling the model to understand the context and sequence of characters in code, which is crucial for identifying potential vulnerabilities.

In the realm of malicious and phishing URL detection, we leverage both CNNs and RNNs. CNNs help extract essential features from URL structures, such as domain and path, while RNNs capture dynamic patterns and anomalies within the URLs, allowing us to flag malicious and deceptive links effectively.

By combining these neural network architectures with NLP, **Secure_Transact** NLP excels in providing a comprehensive and robust solution to fortify your digital defenses, ensuring your online presence remains secure in the face of diverse cybersecurity threats.
