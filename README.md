# Secure_Transact

 The project leveraged the Credit Card Fraud Detection dataset sourced from Kaggle to develop an advanced anomaly detection system. Employing Machine Learning algorithms, such as Isolation Forest and Local Outlier Factor (LOF), the primary objective was to identify and flag anomalies within real-world credit card transaction data. This initiative prioritized automating the detection of potential fraud, errors, or any rare occurrences within the transaction data, contributing to enhanced security and the prevention of financial misconduct. By harnessing the power of these ML algorithms, the project sought to proactively safeguard financial transactions and minimize the potential risks associated with credit card fraud and irregularities, thereby offering a significant advancement in financial security.
